## Project

### Name & Category
- **Project**: Symphony Defi Vaults
- **Category**: defi

### Description
Symphony DeFi Vaults is a decentralized application built on top of the **Symphony protocol by Orchestral Labs**.  
The vApp allows users to deposit assets into automated vaults that generate yield through Symphony’s cross-chain liquidity infrastructure.  

The goal is to provide **non-technical users** with easy access to DeFi yield opportunities, while leveraging Symphony’s low-cost, interoperable execution layer

### SL Integration  
We will leverage the Soundness Layer to secure and verify all cross-chain transactions in our DeFi vaults. By using its verification and deterministic finality features, deposits and withdrawals remain trustless and transparent. The SL also provides built-in protection against invalid state transitions and double spending, ensuring reliability, while its composability allows seamless integration with other Symphony vApps in the future.
